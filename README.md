# Sufsort
NASM program that takes an input string, sorts its suffixes in lexicographical order and then displays the sorted output. The input string must be between 1 and 30 characters (inclusive) and input characters can only be 0, 1 or 2. The suffixes are sorted using bubble sort.

This program was developed as a final project for the course CS 2XA3 and is written for Netwide Assembler (NASM). A makefile is also included for the program (sufsort.asm).
